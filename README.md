# VoiceChess - what is this thing?

This is simple chess program for Windows written in Python where you play using voice commands.
It's my attempt to create something to defend my thesis of engineer degree on Politechnika Wroc≈Çawska - https://pwr.edu.pl
It's based on opensource chess engine named Sunfish https://github.com/thomasahle/sunfish
For voice recognition I'm using free speech_recognitioon module for Python.
Also using Pygame module for graphics
